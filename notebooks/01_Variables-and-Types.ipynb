    "\n",
    "1. Julia doesn't support member functions: **Never** `variable.function() will appear`, but always `function(variable)` just like in C or Fortran.\n",
    "2. Variables can be strings, numbers, multidimensional arrays, and higher-level constructs: dictionaries, structs.\n",
    "3. Understand default types for your system if you're not assigning types explicitly (see [Types](#Types)).\n",

    "In Julia, variables can be global or local scope. **Note: avoid global variables when working in shared code (even with yourself). Why? Name conflicts and types can't be assigned.**\n"

The type system is a hierarchical structure: at the top of the tree there is the type `Any`, which means that every element belongs to it, then there are many other sub-types, for example `Number` which includes `Real` and `Complex`, and `Real` contains for example `Int` (integer) numbers and `Float64` numbers.\n",
